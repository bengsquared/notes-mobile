# Evolution of Knowledge Management

The field of personal knowledge management (#PKM) has evolved significantly over the past decade. We've moved from simple note-taking apps to sophisticated systems that understand relationships and context.

## Historical Progression

1. **File-based systems** - Folders and documents
2. **Database approaches** - Structured data with tags
3. **Graph-based systems** - Bidirectional linking (Roam, Obsidian)
4. **AI-enhanced systems** - Semantic understanding and automated connections

## Current Trends

- **Local-first** - Users want ownership of their data
- **Plain text** - Future-proof formats that work everywhere
- **Ambient intelligence** - Systems that help without getting in the way

The key insight is that the best systems amplify human thinking rather than replacing it. They should make connections visible without forcing artificial structure.

This relates strongly to @productivity-systems and the importance of #systems-thinking in designing tools for thought.

analyze_note_content function feels redundant - the system already extracts concepts and links automatically when reading notes (evident from the metadata in list_all_notes). 

Two options:
1. Remove it entirely - the automatic parsing during note creation/update seems sufficient
2. Enhance it to be a "preview" function - let users test how content would be parsed before saving, useful for debugging or understanding the system

Current workflow seems to be: write note → system auto-extracts concepts/links → stored in metadata. The analyze function doesn't fit this flow naturally.

Maybe replace with a "preview_parsing" function that shows what concepts/links would be extracted from draft content? Could be helpful for users learning the syntax.
